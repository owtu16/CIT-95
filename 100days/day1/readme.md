I'm excited to get started on this new course!

## Video 2

Downloading the course pledge and signing it for myself to pledge for 100 days of coding. My progress can also be updated using the 100daysofcode hashtag on twitter

## Video 3

Tips on looking at the videos on another screen and coding on another one. The other tip is to have a python cheat sheet. Keeping a motivated attitude, she created a 2 hour "study-with-me" vide. When learning new programming concepts, it's important to create notes. She created a coding concept notes. She also recommends using Cornell notes. She recommends staying motivated with "motivational wallpapers" that she created. There's a 100 days of code poster that she wants us to print out where we can keep track of our work. 

## Quiz 1

I took the quiz and I got 6 out of 10 correct

## Video 4

I was introduced to the project where we will a code that will make a "Band Name Generator" I played with the program

## Video 5 

Created a Repl.it account and forked day-1 printing start. I printed the classic "hello world". Learned about strings, which are basically "string of characters". To print these strings they have to be inside the print statement in quotation marks. Also learned about Stackoverflow, troubleshooting and looking for exceptions. We can find solutions to common issues here. 

## Video 6

Participated in an exercise using the print statement. Printed the text "What to print". 

## Video 7

Learned about string manipulation. Learned about using the backslash "\n" to create a new line when printing a string multiple times. With concat we can also use it to combine two strings. 
Indentation error: Be careful about indentation errors in Python. Python doesn't use semicolon but relies on indentation to figure out where code starts and ends. Code intelligence allows us to hover over the code and it tells you what error you have. 

## Video 8

Fixed 4 print statement bugs. First was missing the starting quatation mark, the second one the plus sign had to be wrapped in single quatation marks. The third there was an indentation error. The fourth was missing a closing parantheses. 

## Video 9

input function allows user to enter a prompt. Also learned the difference between the input function and the print function. Using print and input function together we can concatinate strings together. For example: "Hello user" if user is the string that the user enters. Learned as well about Thony software, and how it steps into the code. We can see the code run step by step. Commenting into the code can be done by using the pound sign. Commenting on the code helps read what is going on. Ctrl + / helps to comment out single lines

## Video 10

Ran a function that calculates the length of a name and prints it. It passed all test cases. This code has been uploaded as well.
