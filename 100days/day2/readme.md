## Video 16

Learned we are going to be learning how to build a "split bill" calculator. This calculation will also calculate the tip each one has to give

## Video 17

Learned about data types and the error that we can't get from them. Played around with strings and learned that string characters start from position 0 and not 1. As long as something is inside quotes it's treated as a string. For example: "123" is a string. 

## Quiz 3

I took the quiz and got 3/3

The video is talking about typeError and how different functions don't like certain inputs. We are looking into how to prevent typeErrors, this is by using the function type(), this will return the type: whether it could be string, integet, etc. We can also do type conversion, what to do if you want to turn an integer into a string. Using the function str() it's possible to turn an integer type into a string.
