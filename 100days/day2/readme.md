## Day 2

## Video 16

Learned we are going to be learning how to build a "split bill" calculator. This calculation will also calculate the tip each one has to give

## Video 17

Learned about data types and the error that we can't get from them. Played around with strings and learned that string characters start from position 0 and not 1. As long as something is inside quotes it's treated as a string. For example: "123" is a string. 

## Quiz 3

I took the quiz and got 3/3

## Video 18

The video is talking about typeError and how different functions don't like certain inputs. We are looking into how to prevent typeErrors, this is by using the function type(), this will return the type: whether it could be string, integet, etc. We can also do type conversion, what to do if you want to turn an integer into a string. Using the function str() it's possible to turn an integer type into a string. 

## Video 19

Worked on an interactive exercise where I take one input (2-digit number) and these numbers are added (35 becomes 3 + 5 = 8)

## Video 20

Learned about the order of operation with Python using PEMDAS

## Video 21

I wrote my own attempt for the BMI calculation and then practiced with Angela's solution.

## Video 22

learned about rounding float numbers, printing types, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division shortcuts. And printing with f-string, this way we don't have to worry about converting the data is we are using an f-string. 

## Video 23

I worked on the exercise and my program ran successfully. I looked at Angela's solution afterwards and found both of us had the same answers. 

## Quiz 4

I got 1 / 3 correct

## Video 24

worked on the final, completed and tested my code

## Video 25

I feel great about this course and I am learning a lot. I didn't know about f-string, other things so far have been a refresher to me.
